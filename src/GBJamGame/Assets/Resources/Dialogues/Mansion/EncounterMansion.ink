Oh I remember this! When I was a kid I was so scared of this level! >.<
If I'm not mistaken this must be the Haunted Mansion!
Once inside, I must solve a couple of puzzles to get tree coins so I can  make a wish at the Wishing Fountain.
Then,  I’ll be able to break the mansion's curse and set the spirits free!
I wonder if I can use this to get out of the game instead…
